Objectives
I will explore the data and try to answer some questions like:

-What's the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services?
-Is there any patterns in Churn Customers based on the gender?
-Is there any patterns/preference in Churn Customers based on the type of service provided?
-What's the most profitable service types?
-Which features and services are most profitable?
-Many more questions that will arise during the analysis'''
